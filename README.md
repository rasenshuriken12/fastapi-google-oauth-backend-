# 💡 Objective:
You are tasked with building a FastAPI-based backend for a food ordering platform. This
backend must support Google OAuth login, and maintain data about customers, payments,

- Create SQL tables with foreign keys and constraints.
- Use ENUMs and proper indexing where necessary.

📌 B. Google OAuth
- Implement Google Login with OAuth2.
- On login, create a new user if they don’t exist using google_id.
- Return JWT token on success.

📌 C. Order Flow Logic
- A user can only place an order if the payment status is pass.
- Ensure validations are handled.

# 🔍 Queries to Implement
👉 1. Total earnings of restaurants in Mumbai last month
